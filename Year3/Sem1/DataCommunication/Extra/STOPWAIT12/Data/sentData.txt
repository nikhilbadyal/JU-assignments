Assignment 2: Implement three data link layer protocols, Stop and Wait, Go Back N Sliding
Window and Selective Repeat Sliding Window for flow control.
Submission due: 4-8 February 2019
Sender, Receiver and Channel all are independent processes. There may be multiple Transmitter and
Receiver processes, but only one Channel process. The channel process introduces random delay and/or
bit error while transferring frames. Define your own frame format or you may use IEEE 802.3 Ethernet
frame format.
Hints: Some points you may consider in your design.
Following functions may be required in Sender.
Send: This function, invoked every time slot at the sender, decides if the sender should (1) do nothing,
(2) retransmit the previous data frame due to a timeout, or (3) send a new data frame. Also, you have to
consider current network time measure in time slots.
Recv_Ack: This function is invoked whenever an ACK packet is received. Need to consider network time
when the ACK was received, ack_num and timestamp are the sender's sequence number and timestamp
that were echoed in the ACK. This function must call the timeout function.
Timeout: This function should be called by ACK method to compute the most recent data packet's
round-trip time and then recompute the value of timeout.
Following functions may be required in Receiver.
Recv: This function at the receiver is invoked upon receiving a data frame from the sender.
Send_Ack: This function is required to build the ACK and transmit.
